            <h2>Witchcraft in the 16th Century</h2>
            <p>This mini site discusses 4 woodcuts depicting witchcraft in the 16th century.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="content">
            <h3>What do the woodcuts tell us?</h3>
            <p>The woodcuts reflect deep anxieties about supernatural power, particularly when wielded by women. The recurring imagery of weather manipulation, flying, and causing harm to others shows what communities feared witches could do - disrupt the natural order, damage crops through storms, or inflict disease on neighbors. The woodcuts helped create a shared visual language for what "witches" looked like and did, turning folk beliefs and theological speculation into seemingly documentary evidence. Once people had these images in mind, it became easier to "recognize" witchcraft in their communities, potentially feeding the witch trial cycles that peaked in the 16th-17th centuries.</p>

            <h3>Woodcut 1</h3>
            <figure>
                <!-- Images are now served from the assets folder -->
                <img src="assets/01.jpg" alt="Outdoor sabbath scene: women around a cauldron and spinning wheel, with small demonic riders flying in the background" />
                <figcaption>A lively sabbath scene: witches gather around a cauldron and spinning wheel while figures fly through the sky in the background.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Description: This woodcut depicts a multi-figure outdoor scene commonly associated with the witches' sabbath: women working at a cauldron, a spinning wheel, and small demonic figures or riders in the sky. Images like this visualize testimony and folklore about nocturnal gatherings, the making of potions or familiars, and supernatural flight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interpretation: Such prints often appeared in pamphlets and broadsides to sensationalize accounts and reinforce the idea that witchcraft involved communal, nocturnal rites that disrupted everyday life.

        <!-- Woodcut 2 -->
        <section class="content">
            <h3>Woodcut 2</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/02.jpg" alt="Interior scene showing a horned demonic figure at a hearth or forge while a woman raises a tool" />
                <figcaption>Interior scene showing a horned demonic figure and a woman working at a heated hearth or forge.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Description: The composition centers on a hearth or forge with a horned, human-like figure (a devil or demonic helper) and a woman wielding a tool. The hearth/forge motif links domestic labor with alleged magical practice in popular imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interpretation: This could illustrate the making of magical implements, forging of charms, or the presence of a demonic helper in domestic settings. Prints like this reinforced the idea that witchcraft had a practical, domestic side—potions, charms, and tools made in secret.

            <h3>Woodcut 3</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/03.jpg" alt="A ring of dancers: human and horned demonic figures hold hands in a ritual circle" />
                <figcaption>A ring of dancers—human and demonic figures hold hands in a ritual circle.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Description: This woodcut shows a circular dance or ritual, with women and horned/demonic figures holding hands and forming a ring. The circular dance symbolizes communal ritual activity, often described in period accounts as the witches' sabbath or diabolical festivals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interpretation: The ring/round is a recurring motif in folkloric and trial testimony and visually dramatized the perceived social and ecstatic aspects of witch gatherings.

        <!-- Woodcut 4 -->
        <section class="content">
            <h3>Woodcut 4</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/04.jpg" alt="Central horned, winged devil surrounded by women offering small dolls or poppets, with birdlike familiars in the sky" />
                <figcaption>Central horned, winged figure receiving offerings; birdlike familiars fly overhead.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Description: The central horned, winged figure is flanked by women who present small figures or dolls (poppets), while birdlike creatures fly above. This composition highlights ideas of offerings to a diabolic master and the use of poppets or familiars in witchcraft narratives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interpretation: Such imagery reinforced links between witchcraft, familiars, and negotiations with a powerful supernatural being—an image used to justify suspicion and prosecution.
            </p>

            <h3>Historical and interpretive notes</h3>
            <p>
                Period and style: The coarse linear woodcut technique, schematic figures, and moralizing composition place these images in the early modern printed tradition (broadly 16th–18th century). Without documented provenance, treat them as typical "popular print" imagery from that period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Purpose: Woodcuts both illustrated and sensationalized narratives about witchcraft. They appeared in trial reports, demonological pamphlets, and broadsheet news-sheets and shaped popular perceptions. Historians use these images as evidence of how witchcraft was imagined in the public sphere but caution against reading them as documentary proof of practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suggested reading: Brian P. Levack, The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe; Lyndal Roper, Witch Craze; Keith Thomas, Religion and the Decline of Magic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Provenance note: Please confirm the source, collection, and licensing for each image before publication. Many early prints are in the public domain, but accurate source metadata (library, archive, accession number) should be added beneath each image where available.
