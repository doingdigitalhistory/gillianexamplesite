            <h3>What do the woodcuts tell us?</h3>
            <p>The woodcuts reflect deep anxieties about supernatural power, particularly when wielded by women. The recurring imagery of weather manipulation, flying, and causing harm to others shows what communities feared witches could do - disrupt the natural order, damage crops through storms, or inflict disease on neighbors. The woodcuts helped create a shared visual language for what "witches" looked like and did, turning folk beliefs and theological speculation into seemingly documentary evidence. Once people had these images in mind, it became easier to "recognize" witchcraft in their communities, potentially feeding the witch trial cycles that peaked in the 16th-17th centuries.</p>
