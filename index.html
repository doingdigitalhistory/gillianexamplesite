            <h3>What is Witchcraft?</h3>
            <p>Witchcraft has long occupied a liminal space between cultural imagination and historical reality, serving as both a subject of persecution and a symbol of empowerment. In popular media, witches often embody themes of resistance, female agency, and the tension between tradition and modernity. The film Practical Magic (1998) illustrates this dynamic by portraying the Owens sisters as inheritors of a magical lineage that is both burden and gift. Their story reflects broader cultural narratives in which witchcraft becomes a metaphor for marginalized identities reclaiming power, while also highlighting the enduring fascination with ritual, community, and the supernatural. Yet beyond its academic resonance, witchcraft in media also delights in whimsy—cauldrons bubbling, broomsticks soaring, and spells gone awry—reminding us that even the most serious cultural archetypes can sparkle with playful magic.✨</p>
