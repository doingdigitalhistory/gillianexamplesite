# GillianExampleSite

This is my tiny site example for the rapid development challenge. The repository contains three pages that were rapidly developed with github copilot as an example of basic vibe coding. The project uses four public domain sources and requires students to use generative ai to help them make a mini website. 

## About
The repository is an example of what can be achieved when you ask GitHub copilot to write the code for a mini digital history site. I asked copilot the following: "create a small three page digital history site with a script and style file." I then refined the about page into the project page by adding 4 pictures and asking copilot to add those pictures (I also uploaded those pictures into the site into an assets folder). From there I asked copilot to add this detail to the code for the about page and to update the **img src** to say that the images came from an assets folder. I updated the front page to include details about the rapid development challenge and a short bio about me.
